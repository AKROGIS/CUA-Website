# Commercial Use Authorization (CUA) Website

This is a web page that was developed to provide the browsers
with data from the NPS CUA database. It needed to
work with the CMS and use the latest data without requiring ASP,
Cold Fusion, or other server side technology.  The solution is a
set of JSON files that are exported from the database to the CMS
on an as needed basis.  The web pages load the JSON files and
format the data for the web pages.

This is Angel Solomon's project (GIS provided the basic idea and
a working prototype that she then refined). It is possible that
she now maintains the pages outside this repo.  Certainly the data
is very stale and no longer relevant. The project is maintained as
an prototype for a similar data driven solution in a different
context.
